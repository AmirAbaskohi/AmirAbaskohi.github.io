Greetings! I'm Amir, short for Amirhossein Abaskohi (Ø§Ù…ÛŒØ±Ø­Ø³ÛŒÙ† Ø¹Ø¨Ø§Ø³Ú©ÙˆÙ‡ÛŒ). Feel free to call me Amir ðŸ˜„.

I am currently embarking on my journey as a first-year MSc student at the University of British Columbia, under the guidance of Prof. Giuseppe Carenini. My academic pursuit follows the successful completion of my BSc degree in Computer Engineering from the esteemed University of Tehran. During my undergraduate studies, I had the privilege of collaborating with [Prof. Azadeh Shakeri](https://ece.ut.ac.ir/en/~shakery), [Prof. Yadollah Yaghoobzadeh](https://yyaghoobzadeh.github.io/), and [Prof. Behnam Bahrak](https://ece.ut.ac.ir/en/~bahrak/network), enriching my academic experience.

My research interests span across natural language processing, machine learning, linguistics, and human-centered artificial intelligence. Specifically, I am fascinated by natural language inference and reasoning, multimodal reasoning, controller generation, and information retrieval. My research journey commenced during my second year of undergraduate studies, and since then, I have passionately delved into various research problems. This endeavor has resulted in several published papers across diverse areas, reflecting my commitment to exploring new frontiers of knowledge.

Beyond academia, I am enthusiastic about knowledge dissemination and community engagement. I actively share insights and discoveries through platforms like [Medium](https://medium.com/@amirhossein.abaskohi) and [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@amirhossein_abaskohi), fostering dialogue and knowledge exchange. In addition to my academic pursuits, I have honed my skills in software engineering through practical experiences. I have contributed to back-end development projects at reputable companies in Iran and Canada, including [System Group](https://en.systemgroup.net/) in Summer 2022 and [MateMachine](https://matemachine.com/) for one year since November 2022.

Outside of my academic and professional endeavors, I find solace in the pages of novels and comics ðŸ“š, where imagination knows no bounds ðŸŒŸ. This passion for literature fuels my creativity and provides a welcomed escape from the rigors of academia. Although I don't venture into nature regularly, I find moments to immerse myself in its beauty from time to time. Being in Vancouver, a city renowned for its breathtaking natural landscapes, offers ample opportunities for nature lovers like me to reconnect with the outdoors. There's a serene allure to the great outdoors that captivates meâ€”a sense of tranquility that's hard to replicate elsewhere. Whether it's a leisurely hike through the woods, a peaceful stroll along a secluded beach, or simply pausing to admire the vibrant colors of a sunset, these experiences rejuvenate my spirit and remind me of the inherent wonders of the natural world. Despite life's busyness, I cherish these intermittent encounters with nature, each one leaving an indelible mark on my soul.

I am happy to answer any questions anmd chat about research/collboration! Reach me at aabaskoh@ubc.ca.
