Greetings! I'm Amir, short for Amirhossein Abaskohi (Ø§Ù…ÛŒØ±Ø­Ø³ÛŒÙ† Ø¹Ø¨Ø§Ø³Ú©ÙˆÙ‡ÛŒ). Feel free to call me Amir ðŸ˜„.

I am currently embarking on my journey as a first-year PhD student at the University of British Columbia, under the supervision of [Prof. Giuseppe Carenini](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~carenini) and [Prof. Peter West](https://peterwestai.notion.site/). I am part of the [UBC Natural Language Processing Group](https://nlp.cs.ubc.ca).

I earned my Master of Science in Computer Science from UBC with distinction (A+), under the supervision of [Prof. Giuseppe Carenini](https://www.cs.ubc.ca/~carenini) and [Prof. Issam H. Laradji](https://issamlaradji.github.io/). My masterâ€™s thesis, titled [*Multimodal Understanding of Long Documents: From Topic Modeling to Question Answering*](https://open.library.ubc.ca/soa/cIRcle/collections/ubctheses/24/items/1.0449900), explores two novel methods â€” **CEMTM**, a topic modeling technique for long documents that integrates contextual embeddings and cross-modal alignment, and **FMÂ²DS**, a synthetic-data-generation pipeline to support multimodal, multi-hop question answering in low-resource settings.

Prior to that, I earned my BSc in Computer Engineering from the University of Tehran. During my undergraduate studies, I had the privilege of collaborating with [Prof. Azadeh Shakeri](https://ece.ut.ac.ir/en/~shakery), [Prof. Yadollah Yaghoobzadeh](https://yyaghoobzadeh.github.io/), and [Prof. Behnam Bahrak](https://ece.ut.ac.ir/en/~bahrak/network), enriching my academic experience.

My research interests span across natural language processing, linguistics, and human-centered artificial intelligence. Specifically, I am fascinated by natural language inference and reasoning, long multimodal document reasoning, controlled generation, information retrieval, and deep researchâ€“related challenges. My research journey commenced during my second year of undergraduate studies, and since then, I have passionately delved into various problems at the intersection of multimodal understanding and deep research. This endeavor has resulted in several published papers across diverse areas, reflecting my commitment to exploring new frontiers of knowledge.

During my research journey, I have had the privilege of collaborating with researchers from some of the world's leading research groups, including **Google**, **Salesforce AI**, and **ServiceNow Research**. Since May 2024, I have been working as a visiting research scientist at [ServiceNow Research](https://www.servicenow.com/research/author/amirhossein-abaskohi.html), further expanding my research collaborations. These experiences have enriched my research perspective and broadened my understanding of cutting-edge developments in natural language processing.

Beyond academia, I am enthusiastic about knowledge dissemination and community engagement. I actively share insights and discoveries through platforms like [Medium](https://medium.com/@amirhossein.abaskohi) and [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@amirhossein_abaskohi), fostering dialogue and knowledge exchange. In addition to my academic pursuits, I have honed my skills in software engineering through practical experiences. I have contributed to back-end development projects at reputable companies in Iran and Canada, including [System Group](https://en.systemgroup.net/) in Summer 2022 and [MateMachine](https://matemachine.com/) for one year since November 2022.

When Iâ€™m not working or studying, I love getting lost in the world of novels and comics ðŸ“š. They spark my imagination and give me a fun break from my busy life ðŸŒŸ. I donâ€™t spend a lot of time outdoors, but I really enjoy it when I do. Living in Vancouver, with its amazing natural beauty, gives me plenty of chances to explore. Whether itâ€™s a quiet hike in the forest, a walk along the beach, or watching a colorful sunset, being in nature always makes me feel calm and refreshed. Even though life can be hectic, these little moments in nature remind me to slow down and appreciate the world around me. ðŸŒ¿âœ¨
